#The error with the installation of charset-normalizer, specifically with writing the executable file. Let's try a few more steps to resolve this:

//Step 1: Clean Up Previous Installations
//First, ensure that no partial installations are causing conflicts:

pip uninstall requests charset-normalizer idna urllib3 certifi

//Step 2: Clear the pip Cache
//Sometimes, clearing the pip cache can help resolve installation issues:

pip cache purge

Step 3: Manually Install the Problematic Package
Try installing charset-normalizer separately to see if the issue persists:

pip install charset-normalizer

//Step 4: Install Requests Again
//After successfully installing charset-normalizer, proceed with installing requests:

pip install requests

//Step 5: Check Python and pip Versions
//Ensure you are using the latest versions of Python and pip:

python --version
pip --version
pip install --upgrade pip
